- Write tests for all exported functions and critical logic.
- Use Go's built-in `testing` package.
- Name test functions as `TestXxx` and keep them small and focused.
- Avoid test dependencies on external systems; use mocks or test servers.
- Use table-driven tests for multiple cases.
- Run `go test -race` to check for race conditions.
