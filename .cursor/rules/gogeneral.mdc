- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guidelines for code style and idioms.
- Use `gofmt` for code formatting; all code must be gofmt-compliant.
- Prefer short variable declarations (`:=`) where appropriate.
- Use clear, concise naming. Exported names must be capitalized; unexported names should be short and meaningful.
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction; keep code simple and readable.
- Group related code into packages; avoid large monolithic files.
- Document all exported functions, types, and packages with Go-style comments.

- Use context (`context.Context`) as the first parameter for functions that may block, perform I/O, or require cancellation.
- Prefer interfaces for dependencies to enable easier testing and mocking.
- Avoid global variables except for constants or configuration.
- Use struct embedding for code reuse, not inheritance.
- All configuration should be loaded from environment variables or config files, never hardcoded.
