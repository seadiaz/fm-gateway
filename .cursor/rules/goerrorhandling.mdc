- Always check and handle errors returned from functions.
- Do not ignore errors by assigning them to `_` unless explicitly justified in a comment.
- Return errors as the last return value.
- Use `fmt.Errorf` with `%w` for error wrapping.
- Prefer custom error types for domain-specific errors.
- Never panic except in truly unrecoverable situations (e.g., program invariants).
