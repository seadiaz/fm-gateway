# Active Context - Factura Móvil Gateway

## Current Work Focus

### Major Achievements Completed ✅
This project has successfully implemented a **complete company-centric REST API** for Chilean electronic invoicing. All major functionality is now operational:

1. **✅ Company Management System**: Full CRUD operations with filtering capabilities
2. **✅ CAF as Company Sub-Resource**: CAFs properly associated with companies in database
3. **✅ Stamps as Company Sub-Resource**: Document stamping using company-specific data
4. **✅ RESTful Architecture**: Proper resource hierarchy and endpoint design
5. **✅ Storage Organization**: Company-based file organization system
6. **✅ Database Relationships**: Proper foreign key relationships and indexing

### Recently Completed Features
- **Company API**: Create, list (with filtering), and retrieve companies
- **CAF API**: Create and list CAFs as sub-resources of companies
- **Stamp API**: Generate stamps using company code instead of hardcoded values
- **Database Optimization**: Added indexes and proper company associations
- **Storage Hierarchy**: Files organized by company ID in storage system

## Current System State

### Fully Implemented APIs

#### Company Management
- **POST /companies**: Create new companies
- **GET /companies**: List all companies with optional name filtering (`?name=filter`)
- **GET /companies/{id}**: Retrieve specific company by ID

#### CAF Management (Company Sub-Resource)
- **POST /companies/{companyId}/cafs**: Upload and process CAF files
- **GET /companies/{companyId}/cafs**: List all CAFs for a specific company

#### Document Stamping (Company Sub-Resource)
- **POST /companies/{companyId}/stamps**: Generate document stamps using company data

### Database Schema Complete
```sql
-- Companies table
companies (
    id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR,
    code VARCHAR,
    factura_movil_company_id BIGINT
)

-- CAFs table with company association
caf_data (
    id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id VARCHAR INDEXED,  -- Foreign key to companies
    company_code VARCHAR,        -- Code from CAF XML (RE field)
    company_name VARCHAR,
    document_type INTEGER,
    initial_folios BIGINT,
    current_folios BIGINT,
    final_folios BIGINT,
    authorization_date TIMESTAMP,
    expiration_date TIMESTAMP,
    raw BYTEA
)
```

### Storage Organization
```
tmp/
├── caf/
│   ├── {companyId}/
│   │   ├── {cafId1}.xml
│   │   └── {cafId2}.xml
│   └── {anotherCompanyId}/
│       └── {cafId3}.xml
```

## Key Components Status
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Domain Models | ✅ Complete | Company and CAF entities with proper relationships |
| Database Layer | ✅ Complete | Repository pattern with company associations |
| HTTP Server | ✅ Complete | All REST endpoints implemented |
| File Storage | ✅ Complete | Company-organized storage structure |
| Controllers | ✅ Complete | Full CRUD operations for all resources |
| API Endpoints | ✅ Complete | RESTful company-centric API design |
| Business Logic | ✅ Complete | Company validation and association logic |
| Error Handling | ✅ Complete | Consistent error responses across all endpoints |

## Architecture Highlights

### Clean Architecture Implementation
- **Domain Layer**: Company and CAF entities with business rules
- **Use Case Layer**: Services with proper error handling and validation
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Repository pattern with GORM and file storage
- **Controller Layer**: HTTP handlers with company validation

### RESTful Design Principles
- **Resource Hierarchy**: Companies → CAFs/Stamps as sub-resources
- **HTTP Methods**: Proper use of GET, POST for different operations
- **Status Codes**: Appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500)
- **Content Types**: JSON for structured data, XML for CAF uploads

### Data Consistency
- **Company Validation**: All operations validate company existence
- **Database Relationships**: CAFs properly linked to companies via foreign keys
- **Storage Organization**: Files organized by company ID for easy management
- **Field Separation**: CompanyCode (from XML) vs CompanyID (database relationship)

## Recent Technical Improvements

### Company Management Enhanced
- **Filtering Support**: Partial name matching with case-insensitive search
- **Proper Error Handling**: Company not found vs. internal server errors
- **UUID Generation**: Unique identifiers for all companies

### CAF System Redesigned
- **Proper Association**: CAFs linked to companies in database
- **Dual Identification**: CompanyCode (business) vs CompanyID (technical)
- **Query Optimization**: Database index on company_id for fast retrieval
- **Storage Hierarchy**: Company-based file organization

### Stamp Generation Fixed
- **Dynamic Company Code**: Uses actual company code instead of hardcoded value
- **Company Validation**: Ensures company exists before stamp generation
- **Proper Resource Hierarchy**: Stamps as company sub-resource

## Development Environment Status
- **Go Version**: 1.23.6 (current and stable)
- **Dependencies**: All properly managed with go.mod
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with GORM ORM
- **Task Runner**: Just for standardized build/run commands
- **Development Tools**: Clean architecture patterns implemented
- **API Testing**: All endpoints ready for testing

### Standard Development Commands
- **Start Application**: `just run`
- **Build for Production**: `just build`
- **Run Tests**: `just test`
- **Development Mode**: `just dev` (with live reload)

**Important**: Always use `just` commands instead of direct `go` commands

## Current Focus Areas

### Testing & Validation
- **Unit Tests**: Need comprehensive test coverage
- **Integration Tests**: Database and HTTP integration testing
- **API Testing**: Endpoint validation with real data

### Production Readiness
- **Health Checks**: Basic operational endpoints needed
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics expansion
- **Documentation**: API documentation creation
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization

## Next Priorities

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration tests
2. **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
3. **Health Endpoints**: /health and /ready endpoints

### Short Term (2 weeks)
1. **Error Monitoring**: Enhanced logging and monitoring
2. **Performance Testing**: Load testing for concurrent operations
3. **Security Review**: Input validation and rate limiting

### Medium Term (1 month)
1. **Production Deployment**: Docker and CI/CD pipeline
2. **Advanced Features**: Bulk operations, reporting
3. **Integration**: External system connections as needed

## Risk Mitigation Completed

### Addressed Concerns
- ✅ **Hardcoded Values**: Eliminated hardcoded company codes in stamps
- ✅ **Resource Hierarchy**: Proper REST design with sub-resources
- ✅ **Database Relationships**: Foreign key constraints and indexing
- ✅ **Storage Organization**: Company-based file structure
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Consistent error patterns across all endpoints

### Ongoing Areas
- **Concurrency**: CAF folio management under concurrent access
- **Storage Scalability**: Local storage for production deployment
- **Security**: Authentication and authorization implementation
- **Performance**: Optimization for high-throughput scenarios
