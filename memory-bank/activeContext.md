# Active Context - Factura M√≥vil Gateway

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Areas of Activity
This project appears to be in **active development** with core infrastructure components implemented. The current focus areas include:

1. **Foundation Complete**: Basic project structure and dependencies established
2. **Core Services**: CAF, Stamp, and Company services implemented
3. **Architecture**: Clean architecture patterns properly established
4. **Next Phase**: Likely expanding functionality and adding comprehensive testing

### Recent Development State
Based on the codebase analysis, the project has:
- ‚úÖ **Project Structure**: Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ **Database Integration**: GORM with PostgreSQL repository pattern
- ‚úÖ **HTTP Server**: Basic server with CORS and graceful shutdown
- ‚úÖ **Domain Models**: CAF entity with builder pattern implemented
- ‚úÖ **Storage Layer**: Local file storage abstraction
- ‚úÖ **Monitoring**: Prometheus integration ready

## Current System State

### What's Implemented
- **CAF Management**: Domain entity with lifecycle management (6-month expiration)
- **Repository Layer**: Database abstraction for CAF and Company entities
- **Service Layer**: Business logic encapsulation for all core operations
- **HTTP Infrastructure**: Server setup with proper middleware
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration system
- **Logging**: Structured logging with source attribution

### Key Components Status
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Domain Models | ‚úÖ Complete | CAF entity with builder pattern |
| Database Layer | ‚úÖ Complete | Repository pattern implemented |
| HTTP Server | ‚úÖ Complete | Basic setup with graceful shutdown |
| File Storage | ‚úÖ Complete | Local storage abstraction |
| Controllers | üîÑ In Progress | Basic structure, likely needs expansion |
| API Endpoints | ‚ùì Unknown | Need to verify actual endpoint implementation |
| Testing | ‚ùì Unknown | No test files visible in exploration |
| Documentation | ‚ùì Unknown | API documentation status unclear |

## Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Verification & Completion
1. **API Endpoint Review**: Verify all controller implementations are complete
2. **Testing Strategy**: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
3. **Error Handling**: Ensure consistent error responses across all endpoints
4. **Validation**: Add input validation for all API operations

### Priority 2: Enhancement & Reliability
1. **Database Migrations**: Implement proper database schema management
2. **Configuration Validation**: Add startup configuration validation
3. **Health Checks**: Implement health check endpoints for monitoring
4. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for API protection

### Priority 3: Operations & Deployment
1. **Docker Support**: Add containerization for easy deployment
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up continuous integration and deployment
3. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive API documentation
4. **Monitoring**: Expand Prometheus metrics and add alerting

## Active Technical Decisions

### Current Approach
- **Manual Dependency Injection**: Using constructor functions in main.go
- **Local Storage**: Files stored in tmp/ directory (may need production-ready solution)
- **Database Schema**: Likely using GORM auto-migration (needs verification)
- **API Design**: REST-based with JSON (standard Go patterns)

### Open Questions
1. **Authentication**: Is API authentication/authorization implemented?
2. **Validation**: How comprehensive is the SII schema validation?
3. **Production Storage**: Will local storage suffice for production deployment?
4. **Scaling**: How will the service handle concurrent CAF operations?
5. **Backup Strategy**: How are CAF files and database backed up?

## Development Environment Status
- **Go Version**: 1.23.6 (current and stable)
- **Dependencies**: All pinned to specific versions
- **Development Tools**: Pre-commit hooks configured
- **Environment Management**: Using direnv for configuration

## Risk Areas Requiring Attention
1. **File System Dependencies**: Local storage may not be suitable for distributed deployment
2. **Concurrency**: CAF folio management may need careful synchronization
3. **Error Recovery**: Need robust error handling for file operations
4. **Security**: Input sanitization and validation critical for XML processing
5. **Compliance**: SII regulation changes may require schema updates
